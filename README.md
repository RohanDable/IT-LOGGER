I made React app to track IT department tasks and technical issues. It is actually internal app for IT department. Uses JSON-Server as a mock backend , React-JS, Context API (along with the use context and use reducer) , Redux and Materialize . 

Basically the idea of this web application is ,So lets say you know,someone fixes a hard drive on a workstation or on a server ,this is a place where they can come and they can add that log. So each log will have an I.D. It'll have a message.The technician that added it, it'll also have the date and time and you'll be able to edit logs, set them to attention needed .We can see red logs,which needs attention which can be solved as soon as technician catches them.

We'll also be using materialize for the UI design and Some Javascript widgets like modals and stuff.

Server failure, constant reboot, operation issues, hardware facility issues affects all organization types and sizes which can lead to loss of critical business data so there must be one application which systematically store system logs and available technician details so that issues can be fixed on time .
